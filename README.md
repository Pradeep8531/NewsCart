## Features

### 2. Top Headlines and Categories

Choose to receive top headlines from your country or explore news from various categories, including:

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to introduce features that cater to individual preferences. Users will have the option to view news related to their job or favorite categories exclusively. Additionally, we'll be adding a search functionality that allows users to find news from their desired news publishers.
